## Development Notes
* Comments for the CSS are located in the SCSS File and should be easily understandable.
* Navigation and Services Links are Nonfunctional. All other links should link to content. 
* HTML File contains Links for locall Copies of Bootstraps Source Code and would be removed in a site that would be given over to a Client.
* No SEO has been done beyond the very basics. 
* Accessibility has been improved and given some thought beyond using semantic HTML.
* No custom Javascript was added to the document but the appropriate links were added to the file structure so future implementation.
* Animations were kept simple and only included if they added value to the overall user expereince.
